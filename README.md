# Android App: Traveler Assistance

At that time, the occurrence of traveler accident is high according to some unforeseen reasons, like weather, or there is no gas on the half of way, etc. However, there is no appropriate app for traveler users in market. So I designed this app, and provided 3 main functions.  

1. Provides detailed weather information about location or certain cities and updates per 30 minutes in background. 

2. Provides gas station information and gas prices of every stations in certain distance and navigations using BaidiMap API.
3. Provides Morse Code utility, users can use this function in danger situation.

## Weather forecast Function


App shows users location' weather forecast information, including current temperatures, PM2.5, future 12 hours and 4 days weather conditions. Furthermore, it also provided detailed weather information, such as humidity, windy, clothing suggestions, UV index and etc.
